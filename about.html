        About Me:
    </h1>
    <h2>
        My professional career started as an elementary school teacher.  In anticipation of the birth of my first child, I made the decision to resign from teaching.  My original plan was to return to teaching, but God had other plans for me.  I stepped into a role as a co-caretaker for both of my parents through their end-of-life journeys. 
    </h2>
        <h2>
        Now that it is time to go back into the full-time workforce, I am working toward pivoting into the Technology Industry as a Product/Project Manager or User Experience/User Interface designer.
